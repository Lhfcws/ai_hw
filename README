[Description]
Ai homework:
Based on Sina Weibo (http://www.weibo.com), dig out some information to build a plot and some pie graph for a star competitor.
We use splinter to get the webpage source and avoid the captcha.
While using splinter, the app will automatically keep popping out the browser and automatically close it. Meanwhile, users are supposed not to operate the computer in order to ensure the stability of splinter, especially not to operate the firefox browser popped out by the webdriver. 

[Installation]
1. Make sure you have apache(or any server can run php), python 2.7.
2. Install splinter ( including lxml and selenium ) and MySQLdb for python:
	- Linux:
		# Take Ubuntu as an example. Fedora and Arch are similar to this.
		sudo apt-get install python-lxml python-pip cython python-mysqldb
		pip install splinter

	- Windows:
		Cython: 	http://download.csdn.net/detail/feisan/4301293
		lxml:		http://lxml.de/
		selenium:	http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium/2.25.0#downloads
		splinter:	http://splinter.cobrateam.info/
		mysqldb:	http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/

		Download all above and install them for python on windows.

3. Install Firefox, make sure that the version is not too old.

[Run]
1. Edit server.conf as follow:
	# hostname, use localhost if for test
	# database username
	# database password

2. Demo:
	open liangbo.php to see the demo graph.

3. Open index.php, make sure session can be used in your php.
4. Input a star's name you wanted to know about.
5. After seeing the wait.php page, run generate.py to generate the data.
5. Wait for a few minutes. (may be tens or more, depends on the amount of data and the network speed )
	!!! WARN: If you are running under your localhost, which means the python scripts are running in your PC, then keep patient and do not operate your computer while running! As the running time depends on your network speed and your main memory. And web driver is not stable, so sometimes it may somehow stop without any reason.

5. You can input the name again in the index.php, if the page show you "waiting", then the running is not finished; otherwise, it will show you graph.php which contains at least a lines graph and several pie graphs.
